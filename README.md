# testRepo

## Description
Static landing page for Raborn Media, deploying to a github pages environment for viewing purposes + ease of navigating the repo.

Website built in vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Features Flexbox as the primary component for layout. Mobile responsive. Buttons are currently not interactive, as this would require back-end work. Took a bit over 3hrs to finish polishing everything.
